## 🔥 RAPID FIXES FOR COMMON ISSUES

### "Can't connect to database"
```powershell
# Check DATABASE_URL uses port 6543
echo $env:DATABASE_URL
# Should contain: :6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true
```

### "Unauthorized" errors
```powershell
# Restart dev server to pick up env changes
# Stop (Ctrl+C) then:
npm run dev
```

### "Webhook failed"
```powershell
# Test locally with Stripe CLI:
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhook/stripe
# Then trigger test event
```

### Build fails
```powershell
# Clear Next.js cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run build
```
