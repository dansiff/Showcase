# Auth Flow Design Document

## Overview

**Single Sign-In/Sign-Up System** with intelligent role-based routing for:
- **Creators** (content producers, businesses)
- **Fans/Clients** (consumers, customers)

---

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. PKCE OAuth Error
**Problem:** "both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty"

**Solution:** Added `flowType: 'pkce'` to all OAuth calls:
```typescript
await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'google',
  options: {
    redirectTo: `${window.location.origin}/callback`,
    flowType: 'pkce', // âœ… Required for Supabase OAuth
  },
});
```

### 2. Role-Based Redirects
**Problem:** Sign-in always went to `/dashboard` regardless of user role

**Solution:** 
- **Email sign-in**: Fetches user profile after auth, redirects based on role
- **OAuth sign-in**: Uses callback handler with localStorage role detection

---

## Auth Flow Architecture

### Sign-Up Flow

#### Option A: Email/Password Signup
```
User â†’ /signup â†’ Select role (creator/fan) â†’ Enter details
  â†’ Supabase signup with user_metadata.role
  â†’ Email confirmation (optional)
  â†’ /callback â†’ Create profile â†’ Redirect based on role
    - Creator â†’ /dashboard
    - Fan â†’ / (homepage)
```

#### Option B: OAuth Signup (Google)
```
User â†’ /signup â†’ Select role (creator/fan) â†’ Click "Continue with Google"
  â†’ Save role to localStorage.pendingRole
  â†’ Redirect to Google OAuth
  â†’ Google authenticates
  â†’ Redirect to /callback with auth code
  â†’ Exchange code for session
  â†’ Read role from localStorage.pendingRole
  â†’ Create profile with role
  â†’ Clear localStorage.pendingRole
  â†’ Redirect based on role
    - Creator â†’ /dashboard
    - Fan â†’ / (homepage)
```

---

### Sign-In Flow

#### Option A: Email/Password Sign-In
```
User â†’ /signin â†’ Enter email/password
  â†’ Supabase signInWithPassword
  â†’ Fetch /api/profile to get user's role
  â†’ Redirect based on profile.creator
    - Has creator â†’ /dashboard
    - No creator â†’ / (homepage)
```

#### Option B: OAuth Sign-In (Google)
```
User â†’ /signin â†’ Click "Continue with Google"
  â†’ Redirect to Google OAuth (no role selection needed)
  â†’ Google authenticates
  â†’ Redirect to /callback with auth code
  â†’ Exchange code for session
  â†’ Check if profile exists via /api/profile
  â†’ If profile exists â†’ Redirect based on role
  â†’ If no profile â†’ Create with role from user_metadata OR default to "fan"
  â†’ Redirect based on role
    - Creator â†’ /dashboard
    - Fan â†’ / (homepage)
```

## Key Design Decisions

### âœ… Single Sign-In Page for Both Roles
**Why?**
- Simpler UX - users don't need to remember which page to use
- Existing users may have forgotten their role
- System determines role from database, not user input

**How it works:**
1. User signs in (no role selection)
2. System fetches their profile from database
3. Redirects based on `profile.creator` existence
4. If no profile exists (rare), defaults to "fan" role

### âœ… Role Selection Only on Sign-Up
**Why?**
- New users need to declare their intent
- Role is stored in user_metadata and profile
- Can't be changed easily (prevents abuse)

**Implementation:**
- `/signup` shows role toggle (creator/fan)
- Role is passed to:
  - `user_metadata.role` (Supabase)
  - `localStorage.pendingRole` (OAuth flow)
  - Profile creation API

### âœ… OAuth Role Persistence via localStorage
**Why?**
- OAuth redirect breaks React state
- User selects role â†’ clicks OAuth â†’ redirects away
- Need to remember role selection after redirect

**Flow:**
1. User selects role on `/signup`
2. Clicks "Continue with Google"
3. Code saves role to `localStorage.pendingRole`
4. User redirects to Google
5. Google redirects back to `/callback`
6. Callback reads `localStorage.pendingRole`
7. Creates profile with saved role
8. Clears `localStorage.pendingRole`

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/(auth)/signin/SigninForm.tsx`
**Changes:**
- âœ… Added `flowType: 'pkce'` to OAuth
- âœ… Updated email sign-in to fetch profile and redirect by role
- âœ… Removed hardcoded `/dashboard` redirect

### 2. `app/(auth)/signup/SignupForm.tsx`
**Changes:**
- âœ… Added `flowType: 'pkce'` to OAuth
- âœ… Already saves role to localStorage for OAuth
- âœ… Already passes role in user_metadata for email signup

### 3. `app/(auth)/callback/page.tsx`
**Already correct!**
- âœ… Reads `localStorage.pendingRole` for OAuth
- âœ… Reads `user_metadata.role` for email signup
- âœ… Checks for existing profile
- âœ… Redirects based on role (creator â†’ /dashboard, fan â†’ /)

## Testing Checklist

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. User Has No Profile
**Scenario:** User exists in Supabase but no profile in database
**Handling:** 
- Callback creates profile with role from `user_metadata` or `localStorage`
- Defaults to "fan" if no role found
- Redirects to homepage

### 2. User Changes Email Provider
**Scenario:** User signed up with email, tries OAuth with same email
**Handling:**
- Supabase links accounts automatically
- Callback detects existing profile
- Redirects based on existing role

### 3. OAuth Without Role Selection (Direct Sign-In)
**Scenario:** Existing user clicks "Continue with Google" on `/signin`
**Handling:**
- No localStorage role (sign-in doesn't set it)
- Callback checks for existing profile
- Redirects based on profile role
- If no profile, defaults to "fan"

### 4. Token/Session Expiration
**Scenario:** User's session expires mid-flow
**Handling:**
- Supabase throws auth error
- User redirected to `/signin` with error message
- User signs in again

---

## Environment Requirements

### Supabase
- Google provider enabled
- Redirect URLs configured:
  - `http://localhost:3000/callback`
  - `https://your-domain.com/callback`

### Vercel Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://ithrzpkgpvpxproczrie.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:...
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Google Cloud Console
- Authorized redirect URI: `https://ithrzpkgpvpxproczrie.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Role Switching (Admin Feature)
Allow admins to upgrade fans to creators:
```typescript
// Admin API route
await prisma.user.update({
  where: { id: userId },
  data: {
    creator: {
      create: { /* creator fields */ }
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. Subdomain Routing
Separate creator portal:
- `creator.yourdomain.com` â†’ Always shows creator sign-in
- `www.yourdomain.com` â†’ Shows fan experience

### 3. Invite-Only Creator Onboarding
Require invite code for creator signups:
```typescript
// In signup form
const inviteCode = searchParams.get('invite');
if (role === 'creator' && !inviteCode) {
  setError('Creator accounts require an invite code');
  return;
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "code verifier should be non-empty"
**Cause:** Missing `flowType: 'pkce'` in OAuth options
**Fix:** Already fixed in this update

### User redirected to wrong page after sign-in
**Cause:** Profile role doesn't match expected role
**Debug:**
1. Check browser console for `[SIGNIN]` and `[CALLBACK]` logs
2. Verify profile in database: `SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE email = 'user@example.com'`
3. Check if `creator` relation exists

### OAuth redirect loops
**Cause:** Callback can't create profile or detect role
**Debug:**
1. Check `localStorage.pendingRole` in browser DevTools
2. Check `user_metadata` in Supabase dashboard
3. Verify `/api/profile` endpoint works

### "Auth not available" error
**Cause:** Supabase client can't initialize
**Fix:** Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `.env`

---
