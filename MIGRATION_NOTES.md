# ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements Branch

## UUID Migration Infrastructure (Post-MVP)

**Branch:** `feature/uuid-migration-future`  
**Status:** Ready but not applied  
**When to use:** After MVP launch, once you have 1000+ users

### What's in the branch?

Complete production-ready UUID migration infrastructure:
- âœ… 3-phase SQL migrations (zero downtime)
- âœ… TypeScript helpers for dual-format support
- âœ… Integration tests
- âœ… CI/CD workflows
- âœ… Rollback playbook
- âœ… 30-day implementation timeline

### How to review later:

```bash
# Switch to the migration branch
git checkout feature/uuid-migration-future

# Review the migration plan
code db/README.md
code db/IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md

# When ready to implement (post-MVP):
# Follow the phased approach in the implementation checklist
```

### Why not now?

1. **Current setup is MVP-ready** - text IDs work perfectly fine
2. **UUIDs are optimization** - not required for launch
3. **Supabase AI may have applied configs** - safer to review after launch
4. **No backups on free tier** - migration safer with paid tier
5. **Focus on product-market fit first** - technical debt can wait

### When to implement?

- âœ… After MVP launch and user validation
- âœ… When you have 1000+ users (real scale)
- âœ… Before Series A fundraising
- âœ… When adding integrations requiring UUIDs
- âœ… When you upgrade to Supabase paid tier (backups available)

### Current master branch focus:

**Ship your MVP!** Your current setup is:
- âœ… Secure (`.gitignore`, env validation, CSP headers)
- âœ… Scalable (pooled DB connection on 6543)
- âœ… Tested (Prisma works, Stripe webhooks validated)
- âœ… Ready to deploy

**Note:** All migration files are safely committed in `feature/uuid-migration-future` branch.  
Nothing was applied to your database. Your app state is unchanged.
