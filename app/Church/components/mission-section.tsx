          We are a church dedicated to providing a Christ-centered home for foster children.
          Our calling is simple — to love, to serve, and to build a place where every young soul
          feels the love of the Father. We do not ask for money, but rather, open the doors for
          those who feel moved by the Spirit to give freely and joyfully.
